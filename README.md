This Java program is a console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It also supports advanced functions such as square root, absolute value, rounding, and exponentiation. The calculator is user-friendly, with clear prompts and error messages, and includes a history feature to view past calculations by typing history.

The program starts with the main method, which takes user input and processes it. For math expressions, the evalExp method evaluates the input using two stacks: one for numbers and one for operators. It handles parentheses, operators, and functions in the correct order. The applyOp method performs the actual calculations, while hasPrecedence ensures operations are executed in the right sequence.

The getYNInput method asks the user if they want to continue after each calculation, ensuring valid input (y or n). The printHist method displays the calculation history, making it easy to review past results. Overall, this calculator is a simple yet powerful tool for performing both basic and advanced math operations efficiently.
